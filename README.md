# cosc123_lab_9_q2_extension
This is a project I made due to curiosity after COSC123 Lab 9 Q2. I created this repo after doing the bulk of the coding; please excuse the lack of commits.
[code](./lab_9_q2_extension/lab_9_q2_extension.pde)

Essentially, it uses the superformula combined with human inputs to create realtime animations. I used the website linked below to help me build the software and come up with limits for the variables in the superformula.
